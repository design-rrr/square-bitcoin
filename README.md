# Pamphlet design for ▣ Square merchants and businesses to accept 🟠bitcoin

Think of Bitcoin wallets like bank accounts

A simple handout to give when onboarding/educating a local merchant onto btc. Something easy to hand over to Square businesses in case they respond weirdly to your _"Can I pay in Bitcoin?"_ question.

Edit, translate and distribute it freely!

Front take contest directly from [squareup.com/bitcoin](https://squareup.com/bitcoin) page and three of the educational Help Articles, each with the respective QR code:
- [Accept and manage bitcoin payments](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/8554-accept-bitcoin-payments-with-square-alpha)
- [Convert sales into bitcoin](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/7935-purchase-bitcoin-with-square)
- [Manage your bitcoin wallet](https://squareup.com/help/us/en/article/8574-manage-your-bitcoin-wallet)

The back contents came from the [Flash ebook](https://paywithflash.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Flash-Ebook-1-1_compressed.pdf), as I found it was the more synthesized way to explain the concepts to merchants and business owners.
